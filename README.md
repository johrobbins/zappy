# zappy
Weather app to warn you of those stormy days

### Setup

**Note:** this project uses Dark Sky API which will be ending support in 2021. 

Find the API documentation [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200331192632/https://darksky.net/dev/docs) 

To make requests to the api you need to add a local `Config.swift` file to the project with the following variable declared
```
let darkWeatherAPIKey = "INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE"
```
